## Getting Started 

### Making Changes 

When contributing to a repository, the first step is to open an issue in that repository to discuss the change you wish to make before making them.

### Opening Issues

Before you submit a new issue please make sure to search all open and closed issues. It is possible your feature request/issue has already answered. 

The new issue template contains a number of prompts that you should fill out to faciliate the process of reviewing said issue. 

### Submitting Pull Requests 

Same goes for PRs, please search all open and clsoed PRs before submitting a new one. We do not want duplicate effort.

In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

* Fork the repository 
* Clone the project 
* Create a branch 
* Commit changes to the branch
* Push changes to your fork
* Open a Pull Request in the repository (not your own fork) and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes. 

NOTE: Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request.

## Getting in touch 

### Got a question or problem? 

Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests. Please join us over in the Auth0 community at [community.auth0.com](https://community.auth0.com). Therefore, we will close all issues that are requests for general support and redirect to this section. 

### Vulnerability Reporting

Please do not report security vulnerabilities on the public GitHub issue tracker. The [Responsible Disclosure Program](https://auth0.com/whitehat) details the procedure for disclosing security issues.
