# Project Name

The section after the title is where we say what this library, sample, or SDK does in a few sentences. Consider adding:

- Short description of use case + problem(s) solved. Consider the following ([from here](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/921921604140937216.html )):
	- Have you described what it is and what the benefits are in a way a non-developer can understand?
	- If someone Googles to try to learn more about it, is this description easy to find?
	- Is this description easily skimmable? If someone looks at it for 6 seconds can they be convinced?
	- Do you compare your tool to other similar tools so people feel educated about pros/cons of yours?
	- If performance matters, do you have easy-to-skim benchmarks that include comparing it to other tools?
	- Do you have a demo? If it’s open source, are there well documented and easy to build samples/demos?
Have you talked with developers who may be interested to learn about why they haven’t tried it or don’t use it?
- Platform/language version supported
- Links to the project in other repos (npm, packagist, etc)
- Information about maintained and deprecated branches
- Repo status - maintained, deprecated, etc.

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to easily:

- implement authentication with multiple identity providers, including social (e.g., Google, Facebook, Microsoft, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, etc), or enterprise (e.g., Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS, SAML, etc.)
- log in users with username/password databases, passwordless, or multi-factor authentication
- link multiple user accounts together
- generate signed JSON Web Tokens to authorize your API calls and flow the user identity securely
- access demographics and analytics detailing how, when, and where users are logging in
- enrich user profiles from other data sources using customizable JavaScript rules
